# Stock-Market-Prediction-And-Forecasting-Using-Stacked-LSTM
This repository contains a deep learning model implemented in Keras for sequence prediction and time series forecasting tasks. The model utilizes stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data. It's trained with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error (MSE) loss.
